<h1>Recursiveness on supergiant games, transistor and bastion</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Bastion seems to embrace the recursiveness with a certain tinge of melancholy, a certain nietzeschean attitude of eternal return. Your final decision, to reset time or to evacuate and embrace the new reality, is the only thing that can break the circle. To reset time will only make the calamity happen again (and all the events during the game as well, one can presume). </p></li>
<li><p>Transistor instead is a bit trickier, since there is a strong case to be made that the game world is a computer/program/generic digital environment. The recursion is completely declared, however. Also, there is no escape from it: one can choose to stop playing, but besides that, breach is never going to get his body back, red is always going to impale herself with the transistor, they will always meet each other again in the country, inside the transistor</p></li>
<li><p>Other common points: silent main characters being narrated by another character. Ruckus is telling the kidâ€™s story to zia, whilst breach is actively engaging red</p></li>
<li><p>The kid has a few bad trips, the same as with breach when it is close to a spine</p></li>
