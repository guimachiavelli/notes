<p>notes written one Sunday on the French countryside</p>

<p>Evolution of communal life, sort of describing parts of the process do demotion/transformation of the mysterious, but also subtly linking it to what was discussed on the previous chapter.</p>

<p>A quasi idyllic description of peasant life in Europe before and during the Middle Ages, focusing on the communal aspects.</p>

<p>Festivals served the purpose of tightening social links, as well as partaking on the mysterious; trying to find/maintain order in the chaos of nature, almost mimicking it in a sense, with lavish expenses after mons of hard work - the future would always carry uncertainty and the resources used in a festival could be better used on a famine/drought.</p>

<p>The gathering of communal resources also gave way to some donating more than others and being more blessed/being given more political power because of that. The communal equilibrium is thus altered and slowly promotes a ruling caste of those most blessed. It's a bit of an oversimplification, but that process takes us to current times where the mysterious is no more name rituals have lost their meaning, but are in a sense still carried and respected, at the same time the ruling class is now completely formed and crystallised.</p>
