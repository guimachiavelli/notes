<p>Why should I do a master in design? I am not particularly interested in design. Typography, craft, layouting, projecting, all of these are completely collateral to what I am actually interested in. The Sandburg looks like an interesting place and one that discusses subjects I'm interested in, but I am dangerously bored by concerning myself with how to present those subjects. There is no commercialism in it, which is a good point, but will it be just pseudo intellectuality and fancy excuses to show pretty things that follow a sort of new ugly avantgarde aesthetic?</p>

<p>So why design? I do not know . It could be a good bridge to other things, it could allow me to meet people who can further my practice and help me with the bits that bore me so. </p>

<p>What will happen after the Sandburg I  don't know as well. Pippo says I'm going to become an artist, that what I do is already art (not necessarily good art) and he might be right. But how to deal with the not wanting to belong? I do not want to be an artist (I start to be convinced that that concept is a bit foolish and silly, that it reduces a practice and research and meaning to some sort of silly concept full of aura (Frankfurtâ€™s aura).</p>

<p>I guess that might be why I chose to go with it, to actually spend money and etc to do a masters in something I'm only borderline interested. It allows me to sort of remain an outsider it can be a very bad strategic decision akin to professional suicide , but we'll see.</p>
