<p>study 02 is a machine/author whose sole purpose is to survive and negate the death of the author.
<em>why is this relevant/important</em>
<em>what is the death of the author</em>
<em>why negate the death of the author</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That is not all, however: this relationship between writing and death is also manifested in <strong>the effacement of the writing subject's individual characteristics</strong>. Using all the contrivances that he sets up between himself and what he writes, the writing subject cancels out the signs of his particular individuality.
there are no individual characteristics. the machine is the essential bit of an author. there is nothing but the output of words in verses and the fact that it is a machine. everything it writes is part of its ouevre. it does not exist in any other way.</p>

<p>it takes its words from the decontextualised words of other authors and </p>

<p>I am certainly making this more complex than it should be.</p>

<p>abstract: this is a study. it tries to approach and understand authorship and generative/procedural writing from a conceptual standpoint. it also tries how much one can randomly connect things according to arbitrary rules and keep some sort of meaning based solely on  the reader's generosity.</p>

<p>description: it shows the signed and stamped production of poetry of a very simple machine. the machine creates poetry from its poetry database. the signing consists of a timestamp, its declaration of existence and an appeal to allow it to survive.</p>

<p>theory: writing used to protect an author from death, according to foucault. now it does the opposite. barthes say the author is dead and unimportant and that work and structure is all that matters. this machine "proves" it wrong because the only thing deign of note in those poems is who wrote them. of minor importance is how the oeuvre is open and probably has no meaning besides what we attribute to it.</p>

<p>there. we're done.</p>
