<h1>study 02 - update - theory</h1>

<p>with a working implementation (far from perfect, but perfection is not the aim), I am still at a loss on what are the themes I am approaching/researching now.</p>

<p>this study is advancing on a different manner than #01. there is much less theory behind it, and it shows. </p>

<p>we have poetry, of course. but I am not interested in studying poetry that deeply for this, what intrigues me what amkes this tick will be the crossover between poetry, randomness and our predisposition to find/search for meaning in everything that we find.</p>

<p>in this sense, the continued reading of opera aperta still makes sense. each poem is supposed to be open and essentially deprived of meaning, since they're almost random collages of verses without any relationship between one another. they acquire sense only when read, and even then only barely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>l’arte contemporanea manifesta tra le sue caratteristiche essenziali quella di porre continuamente un ordine altamente “improbabile” rispetto a quello da cui si muove. </p>

<p>la poetica dell’apertura, se implica la ricerca di una fonte di messaggi possibili dotata di un certo disordine, cerca tuttavia di realizzare questa condizione <em>senza rinunciare alla trasmissione di un messaggio organizzato</em>: oscillazione pendolare, si è detto, tra un sistema di probabilità ormai istituzionalizzato e il puro disordine: organizzazione originale del disordine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the problem is on the emphasised bit: since each poem is created by a simple set of rules, there is no guarantee that the message is going to be in the least organised. one could argue that the onus of the order (of the sheet from which we can safely read the work) is not with the creator anymore (since the creator is just a machine/procedure), but with the reader.</p>

<p>while that might make some contrived sense, it still feels like a cop out like giving up washing my hands and saying "it's ur problem". I could keep improving the procedure that picks the verses, but I want the machine to suggest new meanings rules combinations that would not be created by a human being. sort of a serendipity machine, if you will.</p>

<p>there is also the perspective of the author. what if, following foucault's musings, I conceived the writer/machine as a being striving to be remembered and alive, trying to follow the ancient tradition of writing as a ward against death (i.e. scheharazade who would "write" to forestall death). there is a sudden poetry on that, the struggle of an unliving thing to live. that would make a stronger case for a improved, more refined set of rules for choosing the verses.</p>

<p>incidentally, there would also be a new link between the corpus and the our machine that is scared of death. it would build on the bodies of its ancestors (almost literally!), invoking all their might to avoid having the same fate.</p>

<p>perhaps there could be something regarding that story of sartre and the writer on a deserted island, whether said writer would keep writing if he knew no one would ever read what he wrote (is this from sartre or am I just inventing things now?)</p>

<p>in any case, might this be the actual path? </p>

<p>writing to ward off death
writing as a signal of life to the world
the narrative of a computer trying to show his life through his writing</p>

<p>poetry, death, artificial intelligence?</p>
