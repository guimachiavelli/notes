<h1>Ideas on queer core if</h1>

<h2>Plot #1</h2>

<p>Homosexual guerrilla wants to set up Orgonon bomb to bring about a queer government.</p>

<p>The player must get to the tallest building in the city and detonate the orgonon device.</p>

<h3>Places</h3>

<ul>
<li>HQ</li>
<li>Bus</li>
<li>Subway</li>
<li>Library</li>
<li>Bar</li>
<li>Church</li>
<li>The building</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plot#2</h2>

<p>Something a bit more pungent and strong? #1 seems a bit too much like any IF.</p>

<p>Perhaps just a quest for fucking every character in the story? That, however, sounds a bit too much like a porn IF instead. It seems to lack the ridiculous* power from the raspberry reich. </p>

<p>What's the point of this, though? What exactly do I want to say? Or, if I don't want it say anything precisely, why am I doing it?</p>

<p>upon watching the raspberry reich, i was very taken by the idea of homosexual/queer revolution. Not in the real sense of it (I.e., armed revolution trying to overthrow a government or anything like that) but in the sense that, in a patriarchal society such as ours, no matter how assimilated we get, there's still a spark of non-conformity in our existence as queers.</p>

<p>On plot #1, I seem to have copied la bruce, simply and solely. It has been done, it has had its effect and I doubt I could make it stronger.</p>

<h3>Plots</h3>

<ol>
<li>A queer revolution slogan contest (da fuck?)</li>
<li>quest for finding the person you can show your genitals to</li>
<li>have X amount of actions to become as gay as possible</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Ideas</em>
Actions may decrease or increase homo acting levels
Orgonon Mage/saint
Game may end if player acts too straight
Become Orgonon saint === auto win</p>

<hr />

<p>All in all, there's still a certain emptiness to all these ideas. Like, perhaps funny (if a bit trite) concepts, with no real meat to them. It bears to ask again, what is the goal here?</p>

<ol>
<li>Celebrate queerness in its non conformist glory?</li>
<li>Question current queer conservatism?</li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps the aim should be lower, simpler. Those two questions are rather big, and I'm tackling a medium that I'm not completely familiar with. Or, I guess, their dimensions (their “bigness” if you will) depends on how I approach it. Also not irrelevant is the balance between narrative and game in IFs.</p>

<ul>
<li>patching up stories from bathroom stall messages 
<blockquote>
  <p>“Jewboy  bottom wants Bavarian daddy, thick cock, heavy balls, meet here weekday afternoons”
(ref: little joe 4, 53)</li>
</ul>

<p>Something a bit like iOS “warm wisps” and “10 p.m.”</p>
</blockquote></p>

<p>Also, I suppose Craigslist, grindr, message boards would be more relevant nowadays. </p>
