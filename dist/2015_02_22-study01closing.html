<h1>study 01 – closing thoughts</h1>

<p>All the text for study 01 has been written, finally. The numbers are much bigger than I expected when I first started the process and I had to trim down considerably on my initial expectations.I now have 6 scenes (intro excluded), that add up to 13500+ words in total. Considering the actual scope of the study, that’s mental.</p>

<p>That’s mostly due to branching. I can appreciate a bit more how much more content is needed for each branch. I unknowingly based the whole story in branching decisions, but, in retrospect, a better approach to this could have been having a more focused experience with less completely different outcomes. for instance, three different endings, but each ending changing slightly to reflect previous choices.</p>

<p>On the other hand, that would require taking much more control of what was happening and where I was going with the history, which was beside the point of this experiment. The sort of gonzo narrative that was constructed by clashing the anarchist texts and sex ads could only come about with a random approach that took no interest in saying anything in particular or telling a logical story.</p>

<p>——</p>

<p>I’m calling this a study, so what were the goals in doing this study?</p>

<ul>
<li>create a primitive interactive narrative</li>
<li>explore the clashing of academic texts and sex ads</li>
<li>see how those two things play together</li>
<li>formal/design/tech: use only what is strictly necessary, keep it as simple as possible and using as much as I can of standard APIs, elements, colours, typefaces</li>
</ul>
