<h1>Ginsberg reads</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>It is pretty amazing to hear his voice in the footnote to howl. He seems very honestly moved, and my initial reaction was that sort of embarrassment one feels when seeing someone crying, not because crying is wrong or shameful, but because one feels like witnessing a very personal moment that the other not necessarily would like to share.</p></li>
<li><p>The other readings are less moving, but they carry a sort of religious tone, almost as if one were listening to a pastor preach. At the sea,e time, it seems to be more emotional, more enthralling than most poetry readings</p></li>
<li><p>I cannot help but feel a deep emotional connection with Ginsberg. Even though I live in a different world, do not do drugs, do not spend my time amongst people seen was pariahs, I cannot help but deeply love how honest and unaffected he sounds.i do,believe he believes that everything is holy and i do agree with him. </p></li>
<li><p>The declaration of holiness is as deep as simple. Nothing is special, everything is indeed holy and beautiful. There is no man uglier than the other, no man more beautiful than the other, everything is equally entitled to everything, everything should be open to everything. Borders are only conventions, limits are conventions. It's almost,like neon genesis evangelion human instrumentalisation.</p></li>
