<p>Motivate your choice for the Design department. Include the following points: Why do you want to follow the master in Design? Which expertise do you consider of value for this master and what are your expectations?</p>

<p>======</p>

<p>I find myself in a grey area between research, writing and programming. I am interested in the use of code as a path to understand subjects and to explore ideas that do not carry any exchange value, that cannot be monetised, fragile things that barely make sense. I seek to establish a practice through dialoguing with the machine, instead of merely using it.</p>

<p>My research interests go from the cesspit of profanity that is 4chan’s /b/ and the cotton candy world of imgur to the ideology critique of Slavoj Žižek and the melancholy science of Theodor Adorno. As far as I am concerned, they are all equally valid, they all collectively shape contemporary society in their own way and function as reputable sources of reflection of and on our lives.</p>

<p>To explore those ideas, mediums and corpora, I seek an environment that is open to the frailty of processes whilst being profoundly strict in its criticism of those same processes and their results. A fertile ground for discussion that contemplates the fact that everything, that nothing is ever truly finished and that every idea is fluid and might melt and self-destruct at a moments notice. I believe the Sandberg Institute might be a place that facilitates that.</p>

<p>On the technical side, I am proficient in a few different programming, with a special focus on the web. I have worked the past 4 years mainly as a programmer and use the skills I acquired as the fundamental tool for every project. To that I add my background as a journalist and the soft skills the activity entails, such as editing, writing and researching.</p>
