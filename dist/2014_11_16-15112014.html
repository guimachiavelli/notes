<h2>Imaginary talk on why I would leave my job</h2>

<p>The main reason that I'd like to leave is that I do not believe this is my place. I respect your work a lot, and I enjoy your company so very much,but if I stay here so many questions will not be answered, and I might even stop asking them at all.</p>

<p>What is worthwhile? Why do we think about things in terms of worth? Why should we be productive? Are the “data stories” just a way of selling more stuff? Aren't we just contributing to a society that is destroying the world?</p>

<p>What is the life I want? I came to Europe because of a childhood dream. I gauge my life by thinking: would my 7 year-old self be proud of me? I don't how long I'll be able to accurately answer that question, but I want to make the most of it. And, thus, I'm here, I'm independent from my family, so what's next?</p>

<p>When I think about the “perfect life”, so to speak, I think of a green place, a sort of Internet fuelled version of a myiazaki film, and I do not see that happening here. I do not like this world. It makes some amazing things, admittedly and undeniably, but I do not like it. I know things like the world cannot be changed easily, but I believe that just staying, just living it like it is the only option will actually make it the only option. I truly firmly believe that all I can do to improve things is to dream And to try and live those dreams. And I feel London, with its hustle and bustle, with its business at all times, kills dreams.</p>

<p>Naive as it is, I need to try, I need to go on. Nothing makes any sense, nothing carries any intrinsic meaning, and we forget that so often. I do not want to blindly accept the meanings presented to me by this world. I do not want a big shot job with a huge salary. I want a lot of books, something to write with and a simple life, and that idea is simply not acceptable here.</p>
