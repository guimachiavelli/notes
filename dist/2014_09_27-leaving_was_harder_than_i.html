<p>Leaving was harder than I pictured, sadder, also. My father sort of avoided speaking to me and I know things have changed between us. These have been the worst vacations I could ever have pictured. Or not the worst, but anyway.</p>

<p>I've made the mistake of watching normal heart now, during the flight. I was not emotionally ready to see that, to think about things were at that time. At certain points I would think, this is a part of the history of my people. Which is of course very questionable since it is very hard to think about a gay people. I know I do it out of some  attempt to have a sense of belonging, but also because I'd love to be included in that group. It is about them that I think when I say in proud to be gay.</p>

<p>In any case, it is curious how scared I've started getting of flying. It gets worse, each time. I get what I guess are mild panic attacks. I feel so powerless inside this machine, completely at mercy of so many things. As always are in life, I guess, but nowhere else this feeling is as strong as here. Even though I'm so completely disillusioned with everything, I still cling to it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™be noticed something about myself lately. I always think that, had I just a little bit more of time to think, things would be good, I would finally solve everything. I would understand how to use my time, I would have had enough time for myself and would be ready to be with Pippo 100%, I would feel at peace.</p>

<p>I remember this article on the guardian that I never got around reading about marina abramovic and the whole mindfulness shtick that's so trendy nowadays in European countries where, in the end, things are pretty good and one can leave a very enviable life by the standards of most human beings in the history of mankind. Though my Latin perspective makes me think the person who wrote that article is right in criticising abramovic, it is interesting that I feel a carving for that precise same thing. My initial thoughts are that western civilisation has achieved much, but in a way that truly satisfies no one. I think about Stockholm and London and how miserable people look there, even though they keep this appearance that everything is fantastic and great.</p>

<p>I'm rambling. I always am. I miss Pippo.</p>
