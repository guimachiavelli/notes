<p>It is difficult to leave. Or perhaps not exactly to leave, but to</p>

<p>I am not happy. It seems it is a fact of my life for the longest time. I do want to go back to a life that is my own, and life here in porto Alegre certainly isn't, or not anymore, in any case. But neither is my life in London. What am I doing there, why am I doing it?</p>

<p>I know there are no answers to anything worth asking, but there's a blackness in trying to answer these questions right now. I don't like it there. I don't think I can ever be satisfied there. I do not wish for the thousand suns of that place, there's enough sorrow and struggle inside me without them. I do not wish for greatness (which is good, since I don't think any greatness lies in my path). As every hero in every myth, I only wish for peace or even, dare I say it, to go back home. The place that never was and that we are all very skeptical will ever exist.</p>

<p>It is such a silly thing, all this hustle and bustle. Why does a bloody website or digital whatever carries such a huge significance? I can't really understand it, and perhaps that's why everything's so damn hard. I know I am not as stupid as I act, I know I can do so much better, but my willpower falters after only a few steps. I am just not convinced of the meaningfulness of anything I do. Not only in its meaning for the world, but in its meaning for myself.</p>

<p>Julia once said I wasn't really cut out to do anything that has any direct practical value. I know she meant that in a more “artistic” sense, but I think she was right, nevertheless. Sometimes I think I should be a monk. That the only beauty I can ever produce is in simple acts and in wondering and pondering, but distanced from the world. In a way similar to Francisco, I'm very analytical, but I miss his down-to-earth pragmatism, which is rather unfortunate.</p>

<p>Perhaps all that is weakness. Perhaps I'm just weak and disillusioned, believing in some sort of inner, stupid intrinsic quality to myself. As in, everyone says I'm intelligent, thus I must be and intelligent people are important for mankind because they can improve things, they can make a difference, if only they push themselves hard enough, work hard enough. I have been working as much as I can, pushing myself as much as I can, but for what? Pushing myself in what direction? I just can't see anything that I could possibly do being beneficial to the rest of the world, or even to myself.</p>

<p>As much as we glorify it, a designer makes things pretty and functional, but that really only helps selling stuff, and I do not think selling stuff will make anything better. A programmer, or at least a good one, can have so much freedom and power, but again, it seems to mostly aid in selling stuff. It seems that is the end of all activities, selling stuff. Or anything I could do.</p>

<p>I could see myself writing, I guess. But I am very scared of not being good enough, and not being really good means complete failure in that. Even good writers struggle to survive at times. I am pretty much a no one and I couldn't make my living out of writing bullshit, which is every bad writer's fate.</p>
