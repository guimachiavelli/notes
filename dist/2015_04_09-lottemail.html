<p>lotte! </p>

<p>so nice to hear from you. there is something almost poetic about unexpected e-mails. it’s also a somewhat fortuitous moment, considering I have been reconnecting with the netherlands lately, suddenly speaking more with dutch friends and applying for a MA at the sandberg.</p>

<p>I’m embarrassed you remember so much about lisbon: for me, that day is forever wrapped in the fogs of jetlag and emotional scars from family confrontations. my mind was somewhere in the atlantic, lagging a few hours behind me, like william gibson said (he used the word soul, but alas, we’re all bloody atheists).</p>

<p>as to what I’m up to, suffering in london would be the best definition. dedicating the little extra time I have to try and live, read, write and study. by study I mean these sort of quirky little things I’m working on right now. the first one is a story written by melding craigslist gay sex ads and anarchist texts, the second is assembling poems from a database of verses and let my computer write some poetry. if you want to read some silly filth, study 01 is pretty much finished.</p>

<p>it might be a naïve question, but what is the immaterial space in that context? be gentle with me, I’m just a shortsighted computer nerd who should leave the digital side of life a bit more often.</p>

<p>all that said, I’m going to amsterdam next thursday. for, perhaps, The Sandberg Interview, but mostly to see old friends. it would be very nice to see new friends as well. </p>
