<h1>A grain of wheat</h1>

<p>It is slowly beautiful, this book. It's also very hard for a foreigner, someone completely alien to kenya's history, to analyse it, I believe. Not only to Kenya, but to the gikuyu culture, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>The weaving of all the different stories has something very tragic and real to it. Not only because it is about the independence of a country, but also because how a lot of what happened could have been motivated by so many other things. Treason, adultery, people hurting each other because of pride and fear. As alien as the culture may be, those are pretty universal subjects.</p>

<p>Also, the way we mostly hear the story directly from each person is very significant. We don't hear it from an omniscient, ever present impersonal narrator, but from each person. Be it mugo's betrayal, mumbi's adultery or gikonyo's suffering, it's always from their own mouths, confessing sealed secrets and thoughts that were eating them alive. It gives everything a more real tint, the weight of an actual confession. Those confessions are also permeated by a desire to do good, to stop the killing, to be faithful and dedicated and bare open how human our mistakes always are. It is never a deviant, absurd behaviour, it is never a masterminded plan of evil and immorality. It's just pure human screwing up, and it is very candid and sad because of that. It cannot not make one think about one's own life and all the things one wanted to fix, to make it better, how one may sincerely wish for peace, but in the end ine's actions are too human and flawed and just backfire.</p>

<p>I also welcomed karanja's ending. How easy it would be to have him suicide, but he's even too broken for that, and perhaps too coward for such an act. He will just continue his life, broken and miserable twice, for the loss of power and for the loss of love. He took w gamble with the winning side at the time, but the tables turned and everything he sacrificed was useless and just took what he wanted the most even more further away than before. Again, how human and candid is that?</p>

<p>As I grow a bit older, I think what strikes me the most is how utterly lost we all are. Young people tend to think they're special,Mehta life won't get to them, but after some time you release it is impossible. Life will always get you, there will be so many walls and thorns along the road that your spirit will falter. And these are just words, they cannot possibly explain the relentless attack of the spirit by everyday life and grinding. No matter how in control someone might look, they too were scarred and dizzy, searching in the dark for some sort of guide without realising that it is just a huge, immense, endless room. There are no walls for reference, just emptiness. Or perhaps not emptiness, but chaos. And this is the same, regardless of war and peace, independence and slavery, Africa, Europe and Brazil.</p>
