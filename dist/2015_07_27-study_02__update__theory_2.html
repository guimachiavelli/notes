<h1>study 02 - update - theory</h1>

<p>it seems there is not much content associating death to writing, writing as a means to ward off death. of course, it isn't that hard of a connection to make, but I was hoping for something a bit deeper and more researched to give a more solid foundation to the idea.</p>

<p>as mentioned before, study 02 is currently aiming towards: a machine/author that, to protect itself from its own death, writes one poem per day (in a similar fashion to scheherazade).</p>

<p>the machine could sign poems with its name and other info, so we know precisely who the author is. since there are no external elements of research and since the machine is an absurd reduction of the author, it might prevent the death of the author as exposed by foucault and barthes.</p>

<p>the reshuffling of other poets should perhaps be addressed conceptually.</p>

<p>other important point is could be the open work, the openness that is the subject of eco's book. the machine leaves the actual meaning to be decided by the reader and it requires a large amount of luck in the choice and generosity from the reader. how does that relate to the protection from death? do I need to address that? should i address open meanings directly or should it just be a consequence of the approach? does it matter/enhance the meaning that I bring the openness to a more privileged position?</p>

<p>is this a machine of protection against the death of the author? even if only one author/machine? including the openness might be an actual statement (which I'm not sure I agree with, but have no problems presenting as a possible outcome of this particular study).</p>

<p>can the author be saved by the open work?</p>
