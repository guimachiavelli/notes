<p>So, the thing is: I am afraid of what I am thinking, and, most of all, I think this will lead me to complete and irrevocable failure. Something so big and for which I have basically none of the pre requisites. I am not brave nor disciplined nor knowledgeable enough to pull it off.</p>

<p>What I'm thinking is about going full circle, back to writing. It seems like the only thing I can do that still holds any meaning and that has any potential of making any difference in anything. It scares me so much. I'd have to write in English, which is not my first language. I'd have to say something, and I'm not good at that. I'd have to put myself out there, and I'm a coward.</p>

<h1>Write what?</h1>

<p>Everything. Articles about books, commentary on whatever, stories. Incendiary stuff, zizek level, more flammable, even.</p>

<h1>How would I do it?</h1>

<p>In about 6 month I will leave my job at AW. During that time, I will: find a place to live for two to four months and work on the initial texts. There is no plan for afterwards. This is important.</p>

<h1>Why is this a bad idea?</h1>

<p>In most things, one has little chance of succeeding.  In this, This sort of writing thing, one has even less. I am not connected to any university or institute. I am not particularly good. I do not believe in myself. There is no future plan, only this idea. I have no deep knowledge about anything. Anything I write most likely will be destroyed by any undergrad student/midtier writer/intellectual. This is taking the battle to the core. The written word is my shame and my pleasure, what is closest to my heart by far. If I fail so close to home, I will be broken, completely. There will be no shred of dignity, no possible salvation, no excuses. I will be a utter and complete failure to myself.</p>

<h1>So why do it?</h1>

<p>Because I guess it is better to go out with a bang than die slowly a sad and tormented life. Because I'm so unhappy with my current life that I risk losing everything else if I don't change. Because I might die of a stupid disease or on a car/plane/train crash or in so many other ways and when that happens I don't want to think on how I was saving up for something that I will never have the chance to do.</p>

<h1>am I pursuing some intellectualised version of "do what you love"?</h1>

<p>I don't know. I might be. But I guess I would settle with "do what seems right and doesn't kill you nor any chance of a mildly enjoyable life".</p>
